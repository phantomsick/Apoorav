2. Install required dependencies by running pip install psutil.
3. Run the system_monitor.py script.
4. The GUI window will open displaying real-time system information.
5. You can monitor CPU usage, memory usage, and running processes in the respective sections of the GUI.
6. Close the application window to stop monitoring.
